// particles.js configuration
// You can download the full particles.js library from https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js
// This is just a sample configuration that matches what we're using in scripts.js

// The actual particles.js library is quite large, so it's better to include it via CDN in your HTML:
// <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/particles.js/2.0.0/particles.min.js"></script>

// The configuration in scripts.js handles the initialization
